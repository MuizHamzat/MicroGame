# Ghost Slayer - MacGDC Microgame Jam Entry

A small game made (using the Godot game engine) by me and Aidan Heathfield as an entry in the mcMaster GDC Microgame Jam.

BG music made by Lucas Woolfe. Everything else was made by us.

Currently, the project is considered finished, however we may still add more implementations or small updates
